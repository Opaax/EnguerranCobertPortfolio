I have a deep passion for AI programming, focusing on practical applications that bring systems to life.
I love exploring programming concepts through books, from foundational works like Design Patterns: 
- Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by the Gang of Four to more specialized reads.
- My all-time favourite is Programming Game AI by Example by Mat Buckland, a book emphasising learning through implementation.

Inspired by its chapter on graph algorithms and the A* algorithm, I developed a small tower defence project in Unreal Engine 5. 
This game features square tiles for unit placement and pathfinding, where I implemented a custom pathfinding system integrated into the engine's WorldSettings class. 
This allows pathfinding to work across any level without the need for manual script additions.
