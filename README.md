# Code Samples Repository

Welcome to my **Code Samples Repository**! This repository contains selected code snippets and examples that Iâ€™ve worked on, extracted and modified to comply with confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) related to private projects.  

## Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to showcase my programming skills and techniques in a way that is both informative and respectful of the confidentiality obligations tied to my private work. The samples here:  
- Do **not** include any proprietary, sensitive, or confidential code.  
- Are either original creations or modified examples inspired by my private projects.  
- Represent my skills in areas such as [list key areas, e.g., AI programming, Unreal Engine, pathfinding, etc.].  

## What's Included  
This repository contains:  
- **Code Snippets:** Focused examples highlighting specific techniques or algorithms.  
- **Annotations:** Contextual explanations for how and why the code works.  
- **Adaptations:** Simplified or altered versions of real-world implementations to maintain compliance with NDAs.  

## What's Not Included  
To ensure I respect all agreements:  
- No proprietary or sensitive information is included.  
- Code that directly mirrors private repositories has been rewritten or excluded.  
- Contexts specific to private projects are omitted.  

## License  
This repository uses the [MIT License](LICENSE). While you are free to use and adapt these examples, attribution is appreciated.
